# uptitude_assignment

This script contains a python notebook to check which restaurants are open at a particular time based on the list of restaurants provided.

Please follow the below steps in same order to run the code-

1) We need to make sure few modules are present before we start running the sccript. Use command **pip install pandas numpy datetime** for the same.
2) Once done, call function **open_hotels** and **pass path for csv file containing restaurant information** and **datetime** value in proper python format(2023-02-17 23:38:43.315908)
3) The output is a list of restaurants which are open at that particular on that particular day.

Thanks!
